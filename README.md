### Heey there
I'm Barbara, an aerospace engineering student passionate about the fascinating world of technology and how to incorporate it to make the world more interesting.

I'm interested in astrophysics, embedded systems, mathematics, machine learning, and remote sensing.  I've worked with Python,c/c++, embedded c, MATLAB, MySQL, Arduino IDE, Proteus, stm32cube, and Keil IDE.  I want to get working on Rust, people say it changes the whole embedded systems coding experience uniquely; hopefully, that's my next step.  If I can help you in any way, don't hesitate to contact me!
